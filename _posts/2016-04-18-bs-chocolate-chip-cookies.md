B'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES...YUM! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c310033c-425c-47aa-8067-e1bf163ef072.jpg)

I LOVE September! ... the harbinger of my favorite season, FALL! Warm, sunny days and crisp nights...soon I hope! Wonderful memories of heading back to school and coming home to the smell of freshly baked cookies...chocolate chip cookies. My mom did not put cookies in lunches; they were treats when we came home. My sister and I sat around the kitchen table and ate them and told Moma about the day. 

I love these cookies for all the wonderful things they bring to mind and their rich taste. My mom made the delicious recipe on the chocolate chip bag. This recipe has evolved from my having baked thousands of them...and the little tweaks that come from experience and finding La Cuisine and Nancy. I love these cookies for the yummy depth that comes from using the best ingredients. They are not cloying; they are a rich, chewy -- soft inside and crisp outside. We serve them to guests for dessert with espresso, a big red wine, port or a glass of milk! Ingredients matter in baking and cooking -- use the freshest, highest quality ingredients you can find and you will be rewarded! 

Organize and measure your ingredients... ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91c8e50a-5956-4cdf-9241-9c4709a2d5c3.jpg)

1 cup chilled unsalted butter, cut in small pieces 1 cup packed India Tree Dark Muscovado Sugar 

1 cup packed India Light Muscovado Sugar 

2 large cold eggs 

3 teaspoons pure Madagascar vanilla (or vanilla bean paste) 

1 teaspoon pure almond extract 

1 teaspoon kosher salt 

1 teaspoon baking soda 

2 ¾ - 3 cups Antimo Caputo flour 2 cups (12 oz) chocolate chips -- I use Michel Cluizel Mangaro Noir Mini Grammes 

Step one: In a medium size mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda and chocolate chips. Chill in the refrigerator while you mix the other ingredients. Mixing the chocolate chips and with the dry ingredients in advance helps insure the chocolate is well distributed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/068b3d92-b2d1-478d-8f45-07068970dee7.jpg)

Step two: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the chilled butter and sugars. Mix on medium slow speed until just combined. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/65593e34-dca6-4e7b-a65d-6d8078ead4af.jpg)

Step three: Add the eggs, and then add the vanilla and almond extracts. Please note it is very important to use chilled ingredients and not over mix the ingredients at this stage. If the butter gets too warm or breaks down, the cookies run. This is very important; I do not cream the butter and sugars. This photo shows you how the mixture should look at this stage. It is just right for adding the dry ingredients... ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/81290711-8018-4f67-a55d-8dcfe67df2b0.jpg)

Step four: With the mixer on slow, add the dry ingredients until well combined but do not over mix... ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a06efd1c-bd1f-4446-bbc5-668cd01413f0.jpg)

Step five: Remove the mixer paddle. Then cover and chill your cookie dough for at least 60 minutes. 

When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. 

While the oven is heating, scoop your cookies onto silpat or parchment lined cookie sheets. I use a 1.5" ice cream scoop which makes 32 very nice size cookies. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/facad5b7-d979-46f1-b6f0-7022f2bef309.jpg)

Please cook no more than eight cookies on a sheet and stagger the dough-balls as shown. This allows the air to circulate creating a crisp crust and a wonderful crumb. If you use a different size scoop, you will want to adjust your cookie dough layout and baking time accordingly. (Please note if you would like to have fresh baked cookies at a later date, freeze the dough balls in a large freezer storage bag. Remove the number of dough balls out you would like to bake and arrange them on the cookie sheet when you turn the oven on to preheat. The dough will have thawed sufficiently to follow the baking directions.) 

Bake for 15 minutes, you will see the edges of your cookies have just started to turn a lovely brown. Remove the cookie sheets from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove the cookies to a cooling rack. Then eat or share them before you eat too many!! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/267990a3-192d-4ef9-a0ff-e063fc674bca.jpg)
